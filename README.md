## A few things to note:
##
### The Meal App:
#### The meal app is an application I created using the MealDB
#### API through Ionic Framework and the power of Angular5... 
#### or maybe it was 11? 
##
### The Movie Forum:
#### The Movie Forum is a PWA I created for mobile devices also
#### using Ionic framework and Angular. The API used is called
#### OMDB and has thousands of movie and show titles in its
#### database. Have a look!
